<br/><br/>
b. The predominant form of capital shall be Tier 1 capital of which Common Equity Tier (CET1) will form the major component.

 	<li>Treating all corporate exposures as unrated and assign 100% risk weight.</li>
</ol>

 	<li><strong>In the event a bank goes bankrupt does the state provide any guarantees to consumers.</strong></li>
</ol>
The state does not provide any guarantees to consumers in case a bank goes bankrupt however the Bank Deposits Insurance Scheme (BDIS) was formed and is regulated by virtue of Royal Decree No. 9/95 dated 26th March 1995 (with certain amendments to the Law in 2000 (RD 111/2000) and 2010 (RD 70/2010). It is mandatory for all licensed banks receiving deposits to be member in the Bank Deposits Insurance Scheme (BDIS)
<br/><br/>
While the Central bank of Oman’s Board of Governors is the authority responsible of issuing the BDIS regulation, it is the Administrative Committee, which is responsible of managing the scheme’s operations. Deposit Insurance is one of the key elements in maintaining confidence in the banking system and promoting financial stability. It is an integral part of financial safety net, providing certain risk coverage for depositors, prompting savings and confidence in the banking sector.
<br/><br/>
For the BDIS, the initial Capital of OR. 10 million was paid by Central Bank of Oman and the Commercial banks operating in Oman. Since its formation, the BDIS funds have managed to grow from return on investments and the annual premiums that were collected, from member banks, based on 0.02% , then 0.03% and 0.05%, now, of banks total deposits obligations. CBO contributes 50% of banks’ contributions.

 	<li><strong>Are there any rules or regulations on application of interest?</strong></li>
</ol>
As per Article 14 of the Banking law, the Board of Governors shall be authorized and empowered to do the following:
<br/><br/>
(m) To promulgate regulations of the Central Bank prescribing limitations on the amount and nature of foreign currencies and securities held within the Sultanate by licensed banks, procedures to be followed by licensed banks in trading therein, and the uncovered foreign exchange position which may be maintained by licensed banks.
<br/><br/>
(r) To promulgate regulations of the Central Bank establishing rates of interest to be paid on time and demand deposits and of interest to be charged for the loan of money or extension of credit by licensed banks.
<br/><br/>
Accordingly, CBO issues Circulars from time to time on application of interest, the last one being ​BM 1112 - Personal Loans – Interest Rate Ceiling issued on 02 October 2013 and determined 6% as maximum ceiling for interests to be levied by the banks.
<br/><br/>

<ol start="15">
 	<li><strong>Are there laws or rules governing transactions between related parties in the banking sector?</strong></li>
</ol>
As per Article 68(b) of the BL, the total direct or contingent obligation to any licensed bank by a person and his related parties, other than the Government of the Sultanate shall not exceed 15 percent of the amount of the net worth of such licensed bank. In case of a senior member in the management of the licensed bank and any related parties, the total obligation shall not exceed 10 percent of the amount of the net worth of such bank provided further that, the aggregate of lending to all senior members and any related parties, shall not exceed 35 percent of the amount of the net worth of such bank or up to any other limit specified by Board of Governors.
<br/><br/>
Moreover, the Capital market Authority of Oman adopted a Code of Corporate Governance for Public Listed Companies in July, 2015, as updated in December, 2016. The Code states that the company must adopt the highest degree of transparency and clarity when it comes to Related Party Transactions <strong>(“RPT”)</strong>. All such transactions must be subject to review of the audit committee and approved by the board of directors or general meeting (as the case may be) prior to execution.

<u>ARTICLE 15 RESIDUAL POWERS</u>
<br/><br/>
In addition to the powers and duties specifically enumerated and reserved to the Board of Governors by the provisions of this Law, it shall have such other authority necessary to perform all acts required for the proper administration of the Central Bank, the issuance of currency and the regulation of the banking institutions engaged or seeking to engage in banking business in the Sultanate, when such actions or acts are pursuant to the objectives of this Law and are not in conflict with the provisions of this Law and other laws of the Sultanate.

</ol>
Same as above.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="19">
 	<li><strong>What happens when a bank becomes undercapitalised?</strong></li>
</ol>
As it currently stands, the shareholders of the banking companies are not expressly obliged to provide additional liquidity in situations where the bank is undercapitalized due to a shortfall. But the bank is obliged to balance out the capital to the extent CBO requires. The CBO has issued CP-2: Guidelines on Composition of Capital Disclosure Requirements while requires the banks to comply with the Basel III standards of capital adequacy since January 2018. If the bank cannot reach capital adequacy in the timeline set forth by the Central Bank, it could be fined or its license to conduct banking cancelled.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="20">
 	<li><strong>Are there any rules on bank ownership?</strong></li>
</ol>
Reorganization and change in control of licensed banks:
<br/><br/>
(a) No licensed bank shall amend its constitutive contract or articles of incorporation or effect any change in its organization or operation in a manner which would have required such licensed bank to furnish different information in its application for a banking license submitted to the Board of Governors in accordance with Article 54 of this Law without obtaining the prior approval of the Board of Governors to such amendment or change.
<br/><br/>
(b) No person or a group of persons acting individually or jointly or for a common purpose shall own or authorise or record the transfer of more than ten per cent of the voting shares, or the equivalent thereof, of a licensed bank without obtaining prior approval of the Board of Governors to such ownership or transfer, provided also that the licensed bank shall not affect such record or transfer without obtaining prior approval of the Central Bank.
<br/><br/>
(c) No commercial company or other business entity holding ten percent or more of the voting shares, or the equivalent thereof, of a licensed bank shall merge into or combine with or effect a consolidation with any other business entity or issue, authorise or record the transfer of any interest in itself in excess of 25 percent of its outstanding voting shares, or the equivalent thereof, to any person or any group of persons acting jointly or to a common purpose without obtaining prior approval of the Board of Governors to such merger, consolidation, issuance or transfer.
<br/><br/>
(d) No licensed bank shall merge into or combine with or effect a consolidation with any other business entity without obtaining prior approval of the Board of Governors to such merger or consolidation.
<br/><br/>
(e) Applications for approval of any transaction specified in this Article 57 shall be submitted to the Board of Governors in such form as may be required by regulations of the Central Bank.
<br/><br/>
(f) Any application filed pursuant to this Article 57 shall be approved or denied by the Board of Governors within 90 days of the date on which such application was filed and shall be approved by the Board of Governors if it determines, in its discretion, that such approval will not adversely affect the depositors or creditors of the licensed bank within the Sultanate.
<br/><br/>
(g) Any act undertaken or committed in contravention of Article 57 shall be construed as null and void. The Board of Governors shall have the power to take appropriate action on such offenses including the right to order the immediate reversal of ownership of the shares.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="21">
 	<li><strong>What are the most frequent type of enforcement actions taken in this jurisdiction?</strong></li>
</ol>
Among the available enforcement actions available to the CBO, statutory notices and decision making, financial penalties, suspensions and restrictions are the common enforcement actions CBO uses to ensure compliance by the banks.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="22">
 	<li><strong>What are the rights and duties of an individual who controls a bank either as a director or for a business which owns a bank in this jurisdiction?</strong></li>
</ol>
Individuals or entities who are in control of a bank, either as a director or for a business which owns the bank, are required to comply with the conditions of license granted by the CBO, the BL along with all circulars, notices and Rules of CBO and thus, such individuals and entities have many reporting obligations under the CBO regime, particularly, compliance with antimony laundering, terrorism financing and illegal organisation rules and regulations.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="23">
 	<li><strong>Who can be legally liable if a bank fails?</strong></li>
</ol>
As a general principle, bank personnel do not incur any liability on a bank’s failure under the law of Oman. However, directors, officers, managers, employees of a bank owe duty of care as per Article 75(a) of the BL and they will be personally liable if they commit any illegality or be negligent in performance of their duties. The article states that each director, officer, manager and employee of a licensed bank shall be personally liable for any losses or damages suffered by the bank as a result of his fraudulent or wilfully negligent performance of duties, or his failure to act as a reasonable and prudent person under the circumstances.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="24">
 	<li><strong>Are there any taxes levied over common banking services?</strong></li>
</ol>
Generally, interest or margin earned on a financial service is treated as VAT exempt in Oman. What this means is that when one repays a loan in instalments, the interest included in a loan instalment would be VAT exempt. The portion of the principal being repaid will also be outside the scope of VAT. Another example of margin income is when a currency exchange house makes profits by buying and selling currency on spot rates and does not charge any fee separately. In such a scenario the exchange house would not charge any VAT as the implicit ‘profit’ earned by it would be treated as VAT exempt. In the same way, premiums charged for general insurances such as health insurance, motor insurance, fire insurance are also subject to VAT, although life insurance (as a saving product) is VAT exempt.
<br/><br/>
However, explicit fees charged by financial service providers have been made subject to VAT. Charges such as: annual debit card fees; cheque-book issuance fees; international remittance fees; annual safety deposit locker fees; and loan processing fees are subject to VAT. When it comes to trade finance services availed by businesses, charges including acceptance fees; bill negotiation fees; underwriting fees; BG issuance fees; and LC opening fees are subject to VAT.
<br/><br/>
Shariah-compliant Islamic financial arrangements should attract the same VAT treatment as applicable to their non-Islamic counterparts, so that there is no distortion or difference in the tax treatment. Thus, profit earned under Islamic financial products should be VAT exempt and explicit application or processing fees charged would be subject to VAT. There are no other taxes levied over common banking services.
<br/><br/>

<ol start="25">
 	<li><strong>What steps need to be taken by an individual or company which wishes to purchase a bank in this jurisdiction?</strong></li>
</ol>
Article 57 of BL and Circular BM 1121 contain the details about reorganization and change in control of the licensed banks. Both the target bank and the transferee need to seek prior approval from CBO particularly when such transfer would result in change of more than 10% share. Any change in shareholding shall be subject to shareholding restrictions prescribed in Circular BM/REG/40/96. Moreover, CBO will seek to determine suitability of major shareholders including beneficial owners and others who may exert influence on the bank. Sources of initial capital and ability of shareholders to provide additional financial support (when needed), expertise and integrity as part of fit and proper criteria, relevant skills and experience and record, if any, of criminal activity or adverse regulatory judgments (making it unfit to hold important positions in banks) come under essential and additional criteria to go by.
<br/><br/>

<ol start="26">
 	<li><strong>What constitutes having control over a bank and what are the implications of having this?</strong></li>
</ol>
Neither BL nor any circular clearly defines what constitutes having control over a bank. However, it may be inferred from the reading the BL and the applicable circulars that owning more than 10% shares of a licensed bank by an individual or an entity or 25% by an incorporated entity or 35% by a joint stock company and its related party constitutes having control over the bank. Generally speaking, having control over a bank may entail imposition of fines or conditions by CBO as authorized person of a bank and may be subject to other legal consequences or proceedings on behalf of the bank.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="27">
 	<li><strong>What are the main differences between banking regulation in this jurisdiction and other major jurisdictions such as the US and Europe?</strong></li>
</ol>
The CBO, the nation’s central bank, has played tremendous role in promoting and maintaining monetary and financial stability in the Sultanate of Oman, as well as in fostering a sound and progressive banking and financial system in the country conducive to its sustained economic growth. CBO has always been on par with international banking standards and implements them in domestic banking sphere without any delay. CBO recently adopted Basel III regulations in Oman. Moreover, Royal Decree 34/2002 promulgated the Money Laundering Law, applicable, among others, to licensed banks and other financial institutions and Royal Decree 9/1995 promulgated the Law Regulating the Bank Deposit Insurance Scheme.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="28">
 	<li><strong>Are there any special rules of client confidentiality and banking secrecy? If so, what is their impact?</strong></li>
</ol>
As per Article 24 of BL, the CBO officials, employees, consultants etc. are under obligation not to disclose any information obtained in performance of their functions and any violation thereof would result in criminal liability under the Penal Law of Oman. The same applies to any former CBO personnel as well. As per Article 70 of BL, no licensed bank, nor any director, officer, manager or employee of such bank, shall disclose any information relating to any customer of the bank except when such disclosure is required under the laws of the Sultanate and as instructed by the Central Bank. In any case a licensed bank should inform its customer promptly of such disclosure. Except as provided by Article 70 of BL, disclosure of information relating to any customer of a licensed bank shall be made only with the consent of such person, provided, however that a customer of a licensed bank may give general consent to use of banker’s advisements related to his banking business.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="29">
 	<li><strong>What is the typical time scale for becoming registered to provide banking services in this jurisdiction?</strong></li>
</ol>
As per Article 53 of BL, any person desiring to do banking business in Oman shall submit an application for a banking license to the CBO along with other documents stated in the Article. Upon submission of all the required documents to the satisfaction of the CBO, it will notify the applicant about the completion of the application. As per Article 54 of BL, CBO shall, within 120 days following the notification to the application as to the completion of his application for banking license, review and approve the application if the applicant meets all the requirements. If the CBO disapproves the application, it shall give the basis for its determination. Failure to approve or disapprove an application for banking license within 120 days from the date of notification as to the completion of application shall constitute a disapproval of the application. Similar time scale applies to applications for Islamic domestic banking license, however, for authorization of a branch office or Islamic window CBO shall takes its decision within 90 days instead of 120 days as per Article 4.5 of IBRF.

<ol start="31">
 	<li><strong>Are there any special rules on banking set off?</strong></li>
</ol>
No, there are no special rules on banking set off in Oman
<br/><br/>

<ol start="32">
 	<li><strong>Are there any special rules on closure of a bank account?</strong></li>
</ol>
In Oman, closure of a bank account is not difficult or complicated. Closing an account would require the account holder to visit the bank in person, the closure process would entail a notice for closure, cashing out the account fully, and filling out an account closure form with verification; and the bank will require the submission of all debit cards along with unused cheques to the bank. Once completed, your account should be closed within three to fifteen working days.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="33">
 	<li><strong>What are the main rules on cheque issuing and bounced cheques?</strong></li>
</ol>
Generally, in Oman banks issue cheque books current account holders only and opening current accounts requires a salary certificate among other requirements. In Oman it is a criminal offence if a cheque is returned by the bank pursuant to the Omani Penal Law (Royal Decree No. 7/2018). The general rule is that this offence is punishable by imprisonment for a period no less than a month and not exceeding (2) two years, and a fine no less than (100) one hundred Rial Omani and not exceeding (500) five hundred Rial Omani, as well as the civil remedies available to the creditor. Since 2018, bounced cheques for amounts of 200,000 AED or less are no longer punishable by detention in the Emirate of Dubai, where the sentence will only be a fine.
<br/><br/>
Recently, Oman has passed the Law on the Simplification of Litigation Procedures (Royal Decree 125/2020), it applies to cheque related crimes as well in a fast-track process, unless any other crimes are not involved. Article 23 provides that the Misdemeanour Court must issue its judgement within 30-days from the date of the case's referral unless it is suspected that the cheque is forged or stolen. Again, the 30-day period can be extended to no more than 60-days if the circumstances require. There is a possibility of appeal for anyone convicted through this route.
<br/><br/>

<ol start="34">
 	<li><strong>What are the main rules on provision of safe deposits by banks?</strong></li>
</ol>
With respect to the safe deposit lockers, there are no clear guideline in Oman and as such CBO does not regulate or prescribe any policies regarding the lockers services. Some private banks provide safe deposit lockers services for a fee to its clients and each bank individually determines how they will operate this service.
<br/><br/>
<strong></strong>
<ol start="35">
 	<li><strong>What are the main rules on the provision of letters of credit, promissory notes or bills of exchange by banks?</strong></li>
</ol>
Laws relating to letters of credit, promissory notes or bills of exchange by banks are found in the Law of Commerce promulgated by Royal Decree No. 55/90. The Law of Commerce treats all these instruments similarly. A documentary credit, under the Law of Commerce, is a contract whereby the bank (the issuing bank) undertakes to open credit at the request of one of its customers (the applicant/buyer). The consideration is set for a certain amount and a specified period, in favour of another person (the beneficiary/seller), secured by documents which represent the goods that have been shipped or are being prepared for shipment (Article 377).
<br/><br/>
Under the Law of Commerce, documentary credits may be either revocable or irrevocable (Article 380). In the case of a revocable documentary credit, the bank may, at any time, amend or cancel the documentary credit on its own initiative or at the request of the buyer and without incurring any liability towards the beneficiary (Article 381). An irrevocable documentary credit constitutes a categorical undertaking by the bank which is conclusive and direct in relation to the beneficiary, provided the conditions therein are complied with (Article 382). An irrevocable documentary credit may not be cancelled or amended save by agreement of all the parties.
