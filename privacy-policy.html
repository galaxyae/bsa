                        <p>As part of a regional law firm, we deal with entities in different jurisdictions with global presence themselves. As a result, where legally required or while carrying out our rights pursuant to this Policy, we transfer and process data inside and outside the DIFC. Certain countries where we process data may have laws less protective than those in the DIFC and the DIFC Data Protection Commissioner may consider them to not have an adequate level of data protection.</p>
                        <p>Where we transfer your data outside the DIFC, we always ensure appropriate measures are taken to protect your data in compliance with applicable laws.</p>
                        <p>Unless:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>you have expressly consented to the transfer of your data;</li>
                            <li>the transfer of your data is necessary for us to perform the services for which we were engaged or conclude or perform a contract concluded in your interests; or</li>
                            <li>the transfer is otherwise permitted by applicable data protection laws,</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div id="policy7">&nbsp;</div>
                        <p>we will only transfer your data to a jurisdiction classified as adequate by the DIFC DP Commissioner or otherwise where we have put in place adequate safeguards to protect your data. In particular, if none of the above apply and we wish to transfer your data to a jurisdiction that does not have an adequate level of data protection as per the DIFC Data Protection Commissioner, we will undertake all reasonable measures to ensure this protection is set out in a written agreement between us and the receiving entity or that otherwise, the legally required measures are undertaken. For more information on the safeguards and measures undertaken by us to protect your data, please contact us using the details set out under Section 14.</p>
